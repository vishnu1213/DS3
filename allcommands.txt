reg  pdi mcap gdp m3 gdcf fii gds
here y is dependent. suppose we feel that gds is endogeneous  and hence the coeff of gds will be bias and lead us to the problem of simultaneous bias.
reg  gds mcap gdp m3 gdcf fii nds
predict gdshat, xb
reg  pdi mcap gdp m3 gdcf fii gdshat
coeff of gds in model 1 is 0.88 and coeff of gdshat above is 0.72 which means model 1 over estimated the impact of gds on pdi.
reg  gds mcap gdp m3 gdcf fii nds
predict res, residuals
reg  pdi mcap gdp m3 gdcf fii gds res
p value of res is less than 0.05 which means it is significant and hence gds is endogeneous.
